# School_District_Analysis

Using Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook help Maria peform analysis on reading and math scores for students in different schools of a district.
The aim is to provide a summary of the district performance,school performance by type, size and spending

## Analysis

The Overall Pass Percentage is 64.9%.
The pass percentage for mathematics and rading are 74.8% and 85.7% repectively.
We can determine the indivisual pass percentage for each subject is good while the overall percentage can be improved.

### School Analysis

We can see from the table that the schools that have been allocated a high budget does not guarantee a higher overall pass percentage. This may also be due to the fact tha the number of students are more.
We can deduce from the results that the low performing schools are of type district while the charter schools are high perfroming.
